# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Fork this repository, make your changes, and create a pull request back to the main repository. For larger feature changes, please [open an issue first](https://github.com/andrewlalis/slf4d/issues) to enable discussion and awareness before you spend a bunch of time on something. In your pull request description, please provide a detailed list of changes so that it's easy for the maintainer to compose a changelog if/when a new version is released with your changes.
