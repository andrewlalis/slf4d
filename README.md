# SLF4D
Simple Logging Facade For D, inspired by SLF4J.

```d
import slf4d;

void main() {
    auto log = getLogger();
    log.info("Hello world!");
}
```

This library provides a common framework for detailed application logging, while allowing end users to use a logging provider of their choice. SLF4D gives you a basic `Logger` that exposes various `log` methods, and a logging provider will handle log messages generated by your application in any way it likes.

In short, with SLF4D, you can:
- Obtain a `Logger` via `getLogger()`.
- Produce log messages via the various log methods on `Logger`.
- Configure a custom logging provider via `configureLoggingProvider()`.

## Using SLF4D in your Application
All you need to do is call `configureLoggingProvider()` when your application starts, to set the logging provider to use.
```d
module app_main;

import slf4d;
import some_slf4d_provider : CustomProvider;

void main() {
    configureLoggingProvider(new CustomProvider());
}
```

Then, in any module of your application, you can simply call `getLogger()` to get a Logger to use.

```d
module some_other_module;

import slf4d;

void doStuff() {
    auto log = getLogger();
    // Do things...
    log.info("This is my log message.");
}
```

### Default Provider
In case you just want to get started using SLF4D right away, we've included the `slf4d.default_provider` module which defines a basic provider that just logs simple messages to stdout and stderr. In this case, you can go ahead and call `getLogger()` without configuring the logging provider.

## Making an SLF4D-Compatible Provider
To create a logging provider, simply implement the `LoggingProvider` interface defined in `slf4d.provider`. Note that your logging factory and handler should be `shared`, that is, they will be shared among all threads of an application which uses your provider.
