# slf4d
Simple Logging Facade For D, inspired by SLF4J.

This library provides a common framework for detailed application logging, while allowing end users to use a logging provider of their choice. SLF4D gives you a basic `Logger` that exposes various `log` methods, and a logging provider will handle log messages generated by your application in any way it likes. Providers may:
- Format log messages however they like.
- Distribute log messages to other systems (cloud logging systems, for example).
- Perform additional filtering on logs.
- And much more.

Different logging providers are hooked into the SLF4D framework with a logging adapter library.
