# SLF4D Changelogs

All changelogs are included in this directory. Each changelog is a markdown file titled with the full name of the version that it describes. For example, `1.2.3.md`. Additionally, the first changelog of each major version will include a comprehensive description of all breaking changes from the previous version.
