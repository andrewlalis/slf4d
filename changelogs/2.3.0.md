# Version 2.3.0
- Changed the default provider's `setModuleLevel` method for setting the logging level for certain modules, to use regular expressions instead of a simple prefix search.
- Added `slf4d.writer`, a module with a `SerializingLogHandler` that's dedicated to solving the problem of serializing log messages and sending them somewhere, like a file or network device. Includes a handy `RotatingFileLogWriter` which can write to a rotating set of log files.
