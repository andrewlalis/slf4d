# Version 4.0.0

- Added `attributes` as a parameter to all log functions, so that you may
  provide custom string key-value pairs with any log message, for added
  flexibility.
- Made all relevant logging interfaces and global state `shared`, so that
  logging state is no longer thread-local.

Note that this is a major version upgrade because of the changes to most all
logging function signatures, as well as introducing the `shared` attribute
everywhere, but most library users shouldn't notice many breaking changes
unless you're defining your own logging provider.
