# Version 2.4.0
- Added argument `logFileDir` to the `DefaultProvider` constructor, which defaults to `null`. If a log file directory is given, the default provider will write log messages to files in that directory using a rotating strategy, in addition to its usual console messages.
- Added "The Default Provider" page to docs.
