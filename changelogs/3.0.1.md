# Version 3.0.1

- Added synchronization to the DefaultLogHandler to avoid interleaving messages
  between the stdout and stderr streams. Each is individually synchronized by
  the library/system, but both are not synchronized with respect to each other,
  so errors and info messages may overwrite each other when printed into a
  single source.
